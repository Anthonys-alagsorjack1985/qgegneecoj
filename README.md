Wow, just stumbled out of the theater and honestly, I think the last two hours left my mind in a blender or on a spin cycle or something else that twists reality. Borderline - phew, where do I even start? It's like they threw the script and scenes into a kaleidoscope, and I’m still seeing colors when I close my eyes. The theater was such a mess, popcorn all over the floor, like tiny masochistic confetti celebrating confusion. And it's weirdly poetic in a scattered sense.

> Okay so the opening scene, with that dimly lit room, felt like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 something out of an underwater dream. The way the characters spoke? It was like they were whispering secrets wrapped in riddles only lunatics or poets would get. Think Kafka meets Tarantino in a smoky bar discussing the meaning of life—or the lack thereof. By the time I got to the middle, my back was killing me but I couldn't look away. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 sucks you in, gnaws at the mind. Someone told me I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but experiencing it in the moment's chaos is, something... unforgettable.

The protagonist, Claire, or was it Clara? Ugh, names never stick, was insane—manic. Her journey—like trying to chase a firework once it blazes into the sky, compelling yet, bursting, ungraspable. There's a scene where she’s running through a field of clocks—clocks! It felt like time itself was having an existential crisis.

I remember someone coughing loudly during the monologue about lost dreams. A disruption that almost added to it? Like theater met life in one collision of banal reality. You'd need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just to fully grasp its whirlpool of insanity, which is oddly seductive in its chaotic rhythm.

Somewhere near the climax, I swear, it was like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 spoke a forgotten language made of neon signs and graffiti. And hell, the dialogue? Like finding an old diary from a future apocalypse—if that even makes sense. Gotta admit, I tried to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   too after someone suggested it, but really, you just gotta sit in that sticky, vibrating theater to truly feel its weird magic. Enigmatic, really.

I mean every leap in logic was matched with my thoughts swaying between Whaaat and Yes!—like being on a seesaw of bizarre joy.

And then, it just ends in this beautiful mess of noise and color, a piece of 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern art crying through the fabric of cinema... BAM! It was, well, borderline genius. Or madness. Or both?
